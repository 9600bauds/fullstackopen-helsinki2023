    browser->>+server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note<br/>note=Hello%21
    note left of server: The user won't really know what the server is doing.<br>Probably adding the note to a database.
    server-->>-browser: 302 Found<br/>location: /exampleapp/notes

    note over browser,server: The server has now received the POST request.<br/>It simply responds by telling the browser to redirect to<br/>/exampleapp/notes, which is effectively a refresh.<br/>The note that we submitted won't be visible until the page refreshes.

    server-->>-browser: <HTML Document>

    browser->>+server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.js
